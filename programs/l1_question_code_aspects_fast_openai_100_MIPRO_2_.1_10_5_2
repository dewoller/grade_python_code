For this command, you may assume that the user always provides two numbers, for example `!divide 1.5 5`. Like the previous task, you only need to define the function and we will worry about accepting user input later.\n\n_Hint: The `payload` argument for all of the chatbot commands will always be a list of strings. For the `bot_divide()` function specifically, the first element of this list will be the numerator (as a string) and the second element will be the denominator (as a string). In order to perform division, you will need to convert these elements to another type._\n\nWhen it comes to displaying the result, the chatbot must **show the full equation** with the answer inside it, not just the answer. The numerator and denominator must be displayed exactly as the user typed them, and the answer must be displayed to 4 decimal places. So, if the user wants to divide `10.00` by `2`, then the full chatbot output should be `10.00 \/ 2 = 5.0000`.\n\n#### Examples for testing\n\nUse the examples below, as well as your own examples, to test your code. The output from your chatbot should exactly match what is shown here.\n\n```python\nbot_divide(['1.5', '5'])\n```\n\n<font face=\"monospace\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#800000\"><b>Chatbot:<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5 \/ 5 = 0.3000\n<\/font>\n\n```python\nbot_divide(['10.00', '2'])\n```\n\n<font face=\"monospace\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#800000\"><b>Chatbot:<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.00 \/ 2 = 5.0000\n<\/font>\n\n```python\nbot_divide(['3', '7.0'])\n```\n\n<font face=\"monospace\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#800000\"><b>Chatbot:<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 \/ 7.0 = 0.4286\n<\/font>\n\n#### Criteria\n\n- Uses data from the payload to determine the numerator and denominator of the division.

(2 marks)\n- Displays the result as an equation using the `bot_say()` function.
