Like `!divide`, you may assume that the user always provides two numbers. However, in this case they will also be whole numbers. The first of these numbers represents the value to start counting from. The second number represents how many times to count. The bot always counts by ones in ascending order (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5 when starting at 2 and counting 4 times).\n\nIf the payload contains only one number, that number represents how many times to count and the bot should count up from 1. I recommend solving the task without this feature first, and then adding it afterwards.\n\n#### Examples for testing\n\nUse the examples below, as well as your own examples, to test your code.

For example, the name of topic 1 is \"Algorithms and Flowcharts\". You will need to define a list constant which contains all of the topic names in order. You are _not_ to include the word \"Topic\" or the topic numbers in the list (i.e. do not put \"Topic 1: Algorithms and Flowcharts\" in the list, put \"Algorithms and Flowcharts\" instead). The topic number should be added dynamically by the program instead (per the flowchart).\n\nThe behaviour of the `!topic` command is described in the flowchart below. Your solution should implement this algorithm as closely as possible.\n\n\nNote that one of the steps the flowchart involves generating a random number. You must import and make use of the `random` module from the Python Standard Library to do this. Consult [the documentation for the `random` module](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/random.html) and select an appropriate function to use for this part of your solution. For information about importing modules, refer to Topic 9.\n\n#### Examples for testing\n\nUse the examples below, as well as your own examples, to test your code. The output from your chatbot should exactly match what is shown here.\n\n```python\nbot_topic(['1'])\n```\n\n<font face=\"monospace\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#800000\"><b>Chatbot:<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic 1: Algorithms and Flowcharts\n<\/font>\n\n```python\nbot_topic([])\n```\n\n<font face=\"monospace\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#800000\"><b>Chatbot:<\/b><\/font>\n<br\/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic 7: Data Structures\n<\/font>\n\n(Note: for this last example the selected topic is meant to be random, so your code should display different topics across different runs).\n\n#### Criteria\n\n- Correct definition of the list constant. (4 marks)\n- Correct function definition. (2 marks)\n- Generates a random number in the correct range using the `random` module. (3 marks)\n- Indexes the list constant correctly to get the topic name. (2 marks)\n- Program behaviour otherwise matches the flowchart.
