        "question_text": "### Task 6: Chatbot command processor (15 marks)\n\nNow that we have a few different chatbot command behaviours implemented, let's start tying everything together. We will do this in two parts. In this task, we will write a function which *dispatches* commands. That is, it looks at a command and determines which bot function to call. In the next task, we will use this function to build a simple simulated chat system with user input.\n\nFirstly, create a dictionary constant which associates command names (strings) with function objects (command behaviours). For example, the key\/value for the hello command should be `'!hello': bot_hello`. Importantly, the value should be the function name only (no brackets afterwards), otherwise Python will attempt to call the function during definition of the dictionary. There should be five commands in total from previous tasks.\n\nNext, define a function called `dispatch_bot_command`. This function should have two parameters: the first is the name of the command (e.g. `\"!shout\"`), and the second is the payload (e.g. `[\"i\", \"love\", \"python\"]`). The code inside the function should check whether the command is in the dictionary constant. If it is, it should call the associated function. If it is not, the bot should say \"Unknown command\" and the name of the unrecognised command.\n\n_Hint: A function can be stored in a variable (or dictionary) just like any other kind of object, and can be called using that variable name instead of the function name. So if you retrieve a function from a dictionary and store it in a variable called `my_function`, you can call it using `my_function(...)`._\n\n#### Examples for testing\n\nUse the examples below, as well as your own examples, to test your code.

Like `!divide`, you may assume that the user always provides two numbers. However, in this case they will also be whole numbers. The first of these numbers represents the value to start counting from. The second number represents how many times to count. The bot always counts by ones in ascending order (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5 when starting at 2 and counting 4 times).\n\nIf the payload contains only one number, that number represents how many times to count and the bot should count up from 1.
