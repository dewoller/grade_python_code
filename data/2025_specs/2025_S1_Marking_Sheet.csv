,,,
Task 2,Joins list elements from payload to make a single string,,2
,Converts the message to lowercase,,2
,Correctly displays output by calling the bot_say() function,,2
,Includes an additional test call to bot_shout() with a different (but appropriately typed) argument,,2
,SUBTOTAL,0,8
,,,
Task 3,Uses data from the payload to determine the numbers needed for multiplication,,3
,Performs multiplication using an appropriate expression,,1
,Converts elements in the payload to an appropriate type,,2
,Displays the result as an equation using the bot_say() function,,2
,"Displays both numbers in the output exactly as the user typed them (in the same order), but the answer to 4 decimal places",,2
,SUBTOTAL,0,10
,,,
Task 4,"Correct function definition (def, function name, parameters)",,2
,Converts elements in the payload to an appropriate type,,2
,Uses a loop to repeatedly call bot_say(),,2
,The loop repeats the correct number of times,,2
,"The correct numbers are displayed, with one number per chatbot message",,2
,"The bot aggregates the sum of counted values and, after finishing counting, uses `bot_say()` to display the total sum.",,3
,The bot correctly counts up from one when only a single value is provided in the payload,,2
,SUBTOTAL,0,15
